This repository contains a Firefox extension that enables keyboard
navigation of WAI-ARIA landmarks. To install the extension, download
the landmarks.xpi file then drag it over a Firefox window and release.
Then follow the installation instructions.

Landmarks may be navigated via hotkey or via the Firefox Tools menu
item.

The following WAI-ARIA landmarks are supported:

application*
banner
complementary
contentinfo
form*
main
navigation
region*
search

* Note that application, form and region roles are considered navigable
  landmarks only when they are labelled with aria-label or aria-labelledby.

Landmarks may be navigated using one of two methods:

1) Navigate landmarks via hot key.
      Pressing the "n" key navigates forward through landmarks.
      Pressing the "p" key navigates backward through landmarks.

	  The "n" and "p" keys are default navigation keys.  The defaults may
      be changed by navigating to Tools->Add-ons.  Select the "options"
      button on the "WAI-ARIA landmark keyboard navigation 1.0" extension.

	  Note that some navigation key settings may interfere with other
      application shortcut keys or your browser's shortcut keys.

	  Use Tools->Add-ons->options, to enable rendering a border around an
      element having a landmark role.  Three boarder options are available
      as follows:

			* No border drawn around focused element Persistent border
			* drawn around focused element Momentary border drawn around
			* focused element

2) Navigate landmarks from the Tools->Landmarks menu item.
      The landmarks menu item presents a list of page landmarks allowing the
      user to select one. If landmarks are nested, the landmarks menu item
      indents entries to reflect nesting.  If landmark labels are present via
      aria-label or aria-labelledby, the labels are shown.
