I am in the process of converting it to using the new, relatively cross-browser, WebExtensions API (in the [`convert-to-webextension`](https://github.com/matatk/landmarks/tree/convert-to-webextension) branch) and will merge that in here ASAP.\r\n\r\nThis repository contains a Firefox extension that enables keyboard\r\nnavigation of WAI-ARIA landmarks (including [implicit landmarks in HTML5\r\nelements](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/dom.html#sec-strong-native-semantics)).\r\nLandmarks may be navigated via hotkey or via the Firefox `Tools` menu\r\nitem. The following WAI-ARIA landmarks are supported:\r\n\r\n-   application (1)\r\n-   banner\r\n-   complementary\r\n-   contentinfo\r\n-   form (1)\r\n-   main\r\n-   navigation\r\n-   region (1)\r\n-   search\r\n\r\n**Note 1:** that application, form and region roles are considered\r\nnavigable landmarks only when they are labelled with `aria-label` or\r\n`aria-labelledby`.\r\n\r\n**Note 2:** header and footer elements are not considered landmarks when\r\nthey are contained within an article or a section element.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTo install the extension, download the landmarks.xpi file (from the\r\n[latest release](https://github.com/matatk/landmarks/releases/latest))\r\nthen drag it over a Firefox window and release. Then follow the\r\ninstallation instructions.\r\n\r\nYou can build the code into an XPI file. On UNIX-like systems, use\r\n`build.sh` and on Windows you can use `build.bat`. There are also\r\nscripts that build and then open Firefox to install the extension:\r\n`install-mac.sh` and `install-windows.bat`.\r\n\r\nNavigating Landmarks\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nLandmarks may be navigated using one of two methods:\r\n\r\n### Navigate landmarks via hot key\r\n\r\n-   Pressing the \"n\" key navigates forward through landmarks.\r\n-   Pressing the \"p\" key navigates backward through landmarks.\r\n\r\nThe \"n\" and \"p\" keys are default navigation keys. The defaults may be\r\nchanged by navigating to `Tools` → `Add-ons`. Select the \"Options\" or\r\n\"Preferences\" button on the \"WAI-ARIA landmark keyboard navigation\"\r\nextension.\r\n\r\nNote that some navigation key settings may interfere with other\r\napplication shortcut keys or your browser's shortcut keys.\r\n\r\n### Navigate landmarks from the `Tools` → `Landmarks` menu\r\n\r\nThe landmarks menu item presents a list of page landmarks allowing the\r\nuser to select one. If landmarks are nested, the landmarks menu item\r\nindents entries to reflect nesting. If landmark labels are present via\r\n`aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`, the labels are shown.\r\n\r\n### Border Options\r\n\r\nUse `Tools` → `Add-ons` → `Options`/`Preferences`, to enable rendering a\r\nborder around an element having a landmark role. Three border options\r\nare available as follows:\r\n\r\n-   No border drawn around focused element\r\n-   Persistent border drawn around focused element\r\n-   Momentary border drawn around focused element (which is the default)\r\n\r\nTest Pages\r\n----------\r\n\r\n-   ARIA landmarks:\r\n    http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/roles-land.html\r\n-   HTML 5 structural elements:\r\n    http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/structural-elements.html\r\n\r\n",
