<p>Landmark regions broadly signpost the areas of a page (e.g. navigation, search, main content and so on). This extension allows you to navigate a web page via its landmarks, <strong>if they've been provided by its author</strong>, using the keyboard or a pop-up menu.</p>
<p>As this is developed in my own time, I am not able to guarantee timely support, though will be doing what I can to help. I'll be concentrating on fixing bugs, and adding features where this makes sense.</p>
<p>This extension was originally developed by David Todd of IBM. Thanks also to The Paciello Group for donating a significant chunk of the initial development time.</p>
